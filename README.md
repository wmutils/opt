wmutils' opt
=============

opt is a set of optional utilities meant to accompany
[core](https://github.com/wmutils/core).

Just as the core programs, each utility does one job
and does it well, like dealing with window events or names.

utilities
---------

opt has less utilities than core, here is a little overview:

* chwb3 - control an inner window border and two outer window borders
* chwb2 - control two different window borders
* wew   - print window events
* wname - print a window's name
* xmmv  - move a window with the mouse
* xmrs  - resize a window with the mouse

For more information, refer to the programs manpages.

dependencies
------------

Like core, opt depends only on the XCB library.
